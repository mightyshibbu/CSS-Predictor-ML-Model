CSS Padding Prediction Using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates the use of a linear regression model to predict padding values in CSS files based on encoded features of various CSS properties. The main goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the padding value for a CSS rule, given other relevant properties. This project uses Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to process the data, train the model, and visualize results.

Background
In CSS, padding is the space between the content of an element and its border. Predicting padding based on other CSS properties can be useful for creating dynamic layouts, responsive designs, or even auto-generating style suggestions.

This project focuses on training a regression model to predict the padding attribute of CSS selectors based on other encoded features. We utilize a linear regression model due to its simplicity and interpretability.

Project Workflow
The project follows these steps:

Data Collection: A dataset containing CSS properties and their corresponding padding values was collected. The dataset is then pre-processed by encoding categorical variables.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, standardizing features, and removing irrelevant columns.
Model Training: We use scikit-learn to train a linear regression model.
Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Visualization: The results are visualized by plotting actual vs. predicted values for better insights.
Dataset
Source: The data used in this project comes from encoded CSS features. Each row represents a CSS rule, with various properties encoded as numerical values.
Features: The dataset contains multiple features, such as width, height, margin, etc., except for the padding column, which is the target variable.
Example data structure:

Width	Height	Margin	Padding
300	400	10	20
150	200	5	0
Target: The padding column is our target variable that the model is trained to predict.
Modeling Process
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
We load the dataset and preprocess it by:

Dropping unnecessary columns (like the CSS selector).
Encoding categorical variables (if any) into numeric values.
Splitting the data into training and test sets (80% training, 20% test).
Standardizing the features using StandardScaler to improve model performance.
Step 2: Model Training
A linear regression model is trained using the preprocessed data. The model learns the relationship between the input features and the padding values.

python
Copy code
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
Step 3: Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
These metrics help assess how close the predicted padding values are to the actual values in the test data.

Step 4: Visualization
We use matplotlib to visualize the relationship between actual and predicted padding values. This gives us an idea of how well the model is performing.

python
Copy code
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred, color='blue')
plt.plot([y_test.min(), y_test.max()], [y_test.min(), y_test.max()], color='red', lw=2)
plt.xlabel('Actual Padding')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Padding')
plt.title('Actual vs Predicted Padding')
plt.show()
Evaluation
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions, without considering their direction.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted padding values.
These error metrics help us understand the accuracy of the model.
